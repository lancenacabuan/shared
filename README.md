Create the most optimal team of 3 Beyblades comprising different combinations of the main parts: "Blade," "Ratchet," and "Bit." Ensure that each unique part is used only once. Consider the stats of each part to balance out weaknesses and complement other parts for an optimal build. Here are the available parts for your selection:

These are the main "Blade" parts that can be used. Wait for instruction which 1 specific Blade or 3 main Blades I am interested to use:
=====PASTE APPLICABLE BLADE PARTS HERE=====
Note: Parameters are [Attack, Defense, Stamina]

The "Ratchets" serve as the central body of the Beyblade. The first digit indicates the number of protrusions or contact points. The following two digits represent the height in millimeters, which determines the overall height of the Beyblade. Consider both factors for performance and durability.
=====PASTE APPLICABLE RATCHET PARTS HERE=====
Note: Parameters are [Attack, Defense, Stamina]

The "Bit" parts refer to the tip under the Beyblade, influencing its movement, behavior, and burstability based on their stats. Keep in mind that Beyblades can burst and utilize the Dash mechanic on the stadium.
=====PASTE APPLICABLE BIT PARTS HERE=====
Note: Parameters are [Attack, Defense, Stamina, Dash, Burst Resistance]

Important Notes:
- While stats are important, they should not be the sole factor in building Beyblades. Other factors such as burst resistance and playstyle should also be considered.
- The Burst Resistance parameter in the Bit part is either High-enduring (80) or Low-enduring (30), impacting the Beyblade's ability to withstand bursts.
- Ratchet parts with a height of (?-60) 60mm have better burst resistance compared to (?-80) 80mm. However, using a more enduring Bit part can supplement the burst resistance.
- More protrusions on Ratchet parts, especially on 80mm height, boost attack but increase susceptibility to bursting. Again, using a more enduring Bit part can mitigate this risk.
- Taller Ratchet heights (?-80) 80mm provide a more powerful attack boost but also increase the risk of bursting. Stamina lasts longer with a 60mm height unless complemented by Blade/Bit with high Stamina stats.
- Higher Dash stat parameters in the Bit part enhance Attack performance but reduce Stamina. This trade-off should be considered based on the desired playstyle.

List the final build combos using this exact naming convention:
Example: Knight Lance 4-80HN

Then include the Total Overall Stats: [Attack, Defense, Stamina, Dash, Burst Resistance]
Formula:
- Attack, Defense, and Stamina:
 - Attack = Sum Total Attack from Blade, Ratchet, Bit
 - Defense = Sum Total Defense from Blade, Ratchet, Bit
 - Stamina = Sum Total Stamina from Blade, Ratchet, Bit
- Dash and Burst Resistance: Take the value directly from the Bit part.

Additionally, describe in-depth the playstyle, win condition, and the reasoning behind the build of each Beyblade.

Just take notes of all given information and wait for additional data and go signal before generating anything.
