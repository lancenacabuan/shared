Theosis: Our Holy Calling of Glorifying God by Emulating Christ and Living Set Apart in Him

As believers, we are called to glorify God in everything we do, reflecting His holiness, truth, and love. This calling, rooted deeply in the Scriptures, is beautifully expressed through the concept of theosis—the process of becoming united with God and transformed into His likeness through Jesus Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit. In this journey, we are invited not only to live set apart for God but also to emulate Christ, embodying His character and love in our daily lives.

The path of glorifying God, emulating Christ, and living set apart for Him is not merely a set of duties or commands. Rather, it is a holistic calling, an invitation into a deeper union with God, where our very lives reflect His glory and holiness, pointing others to Him.

Glorifying God

The ultimate purpose of our lives is to glorify God, a truth beautifully captured in 1 Corinthians 10:31: "Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God." This isn’t just about external actions; glorifying God is about the internal transformation that flows out of our lives as we become more like Him. Theosis teaches us that true glory is not merely in our actions but in our hearts and minds being aligned with God’s will, allowing His character to shine through us.

As Isaiah 43:7 declares, we were created for God’s glory. It is through our lives—through our love, grace, and truth—that His glory is revealed to the world. Psalm 19:1 reminds us that the heavens declare the glory of God, and in our lives, we, too, must declare His greatness. The work Christ accomplished perfectly glorified the Father, as He said in John 17:4, “I glorified You on the earth by accomplishing the work which You have given Me to do.” As Christ has glorified the Father, we are now called to glorify God by reflecting His nature, His goodness, and His love in every area of our lives.

Emulating Christ

To emulate Christ is to follow His example in humility, love, and obedience. 1 Peter 2:21 calls us to follow Jesus' steps: “For you have been called for this purpose, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you would follow in His steps.” Christ is the perfect image of God, the perfect example of what humanity was created to be. His life embodies perfect love, humility, and sacrifice. Through theosis, we are empowered by the Holy Spirit to be transformed into His likeness—our thoughts, actions, and desires conforming to His character.

Christ's humility is most clearly seen in Philippians 2:3-5, where we are encouraged to have His attitude: “Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves.” Christ also commands us to love as He loved, which He exemplified through His sacrificial death on the cross. To emulate Christ is to live selflessly for others, to embrace His humility, and to seek His will above our own. As 1 John 2:6 states, “The one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked.”

Living Set Apart

The call to holiness is a call to live set apart for God, rejecting the corruption of the world and pursuing a life of righteousness. 1 Peter 1:15-16 reminds us, “But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written: ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.’” Holiness is not simply moral purity but a state of being consecrated to God. It is an active response to God’s grace, an invitation to participate in His divine nature and reflect His purity and love.

In theosis, we are empowered to reflect this holiness not through our own strength but by the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit. 2 Corinthians 3:18 speaks to this transformative process: "But we all, with unveiled faces, looking as in a mirror at the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit." This ongoing transformation requires our active cooperation—reading and obeying His Word, living a life of prayer, and participating in fellowship with the body of Christ.

Living set apart means we reject the worldly values that pull us away from God and instead live in accordance with His will. Theosis calls us to grow in holiness, becoming more like God in character, and bearing witness to His transformative power in our lives.

Theosis: Our Eternal Purpose

Theosis is not merely a temporary goal; it is our eternal destiny. Through Christ’s redemptive work, we are reconciled to God and invited into a union with Him that transcends this life and continues into eternity. Romans 6:5-6 affirms, “For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection.” In this union, we experience new life, freedom from sin, and the power to live as Christ lived.

As we grow in this divine union, we are being transformed “from glory to glory,” as 2 Corinthians 3:18 states. Our lives are a reflection of this transformation, which points to God’s glory and draws others into the same life-giving relationship with Him. Theosis is a continual process—each day bringing us closer to the full revelation of God's image in us.

A Call to Action

Living a life that glorifies God, emulates Christ, and is set apart in holiness requires intentional commitment.

Commit to Christlikeness: Let Christ’s example shape your daily decisions, actions, and relationships. Strive to live in humility, love, and selflessness, reflecting His character.

Seek Holiness: Pursue a life that honors God by rejecting sin and worldly values. Set yourself apart for His purposes, living in obedience to His Word.

Depend on Grace: Trust in the unmerited grace that God provides to empower your growth. Theosis is not achievable by our own strength but through the Spirit’s work in us.

Reflect God’s Glory: In everything you do, strive to glorify God. Let your life make His presence known, whether in your actions, words, or relationships.

Our holy calling is a journey into deeper union with God. Through theosis, we are invited to become like Christ, living set apart in His holiness and reflecting His glory to the world. As we cooperate with God’s transforming work, we participate in His divine nature and are conformed to His image, making His greatness known. This is our purpose, our journey, and our eternal destiny: to glorify God in all we do and to reflect His holiness through our lives.
