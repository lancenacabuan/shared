# Theosis: Our Holy Calling to Reflect God’s Glory in Christ

The Christian life is not about following mere rules or outward rituals; it's a transformative journey of becoming more like Christ. This journey, known as *Theosis*, is about reflecting God’s image and participating in His divine nature. It’s a process that touches every part of our being—spirit, mind, and body. The beauty of *Theosis* is that it’s not something we do on our own. It’s a work that God initiates and completes through the gospel, empowering us to grow in Christlikeness through the Holy Spirit. This journey is guided by four key pillars: **Exalt**, **Emulate**, **Exemplify**, and **Embody**. These pillars help us fulfill the purpose for which we were created: to reflect God’s image in the world.

The first pillar, **Exalt**, reminds us that our purpose is to glorify God. From the beginning, humanity was created to reflect and honor God’s greatness. This isn’t just about singing praises or performing rituals; it’s about living every moment with the goal of bringing glory to God. In Isaiah 43:7, God declares, “Everyone who is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory.” Glorifying God is at the very heart of our existence. Jesus showed us how to live this out perfectly in John 17:4, when He said, “I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do.” Everything we do—whether at work, at home, or in our relationships—should be done for God’s glory. It’s not just about what we do, but about doing everything with the intention of exalting Him. **Exalt** Him in all things.

The second pillar, **Emulate**, calls us to become more like Christ. The Christian life is a process of growing into the image of Jesus. Romans 8:29 says that God’s plan is “to become conformed to the image of His Son.” This transformation doesn’t happen overnight, but it’s something we grow into. As we look to Jesus—through Scripture, worship, and prayer—the Holy Spirit works in us to make us more like Him. In 2 Corinthians 3:18, Paul writes, “But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.” The more we focus on Christ, the more we are changed to reflect His love, humility, and obedience. We are called to **Emulate** Christ, to imitate His character in everything we do. This isn’t about trying harder in our own strength, but about allowing the Holy Spirit to transform us from the inside out.

The third pillar, **Exemplify**, calls us to live lives of holiness. Holiness is not about perfection, but about living a life set apart for God. In 1 Peter 1:15-16, we are reminded, “But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.’” Holiness is not just an outward appearance, but an inner transformation that leads us to reject sin and pursue God’s will. It’s about offering our lives to God as living sacrifices, as Romans 12:1-2 urges us. We are called to **Exemplify** holiness by living according to God’s Word, rejecting the patterns of the world, and continually striving to reflect His purity and righteousness in everything we do.

The final pillar, **Embody**, is about our union with Christ. This union with Jesus is the foundation of our spiritual transformation. In John 15:5, Jesus says, “I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.” Our relationship with Christ is the source of all spiritual growth. It’s not about trying to live the Christian life on our own strength, but about depending on Christ to live through us. Paul echoes this in Galatians 2:20, saying, “I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” **Embody** this union with Christ by remaining in constant fellowship with Him, trusting that He will work in and through you to accomplish His purposes.

As we journey through *Theosis*, we are called to **Exalt** God, **Emulate** Christ, **Exemplify** holiness, and **Embody** our union with Christ. These four pillars guide us in becoming the people God created us to be. This process is both a present reality and a future hope. As we grow in Christlikeness, we look forward to the day when we will see Christ face to face, and the work He has begun in us will be completed. Until then, we press on, knowing that God is faithfully at work within us, shaping us to reflect His glory. Let us live out these pillars of *Theosis*, trusting that God will bring to completion the good work He has begun in us, for His glory and our eternal good.

## **Glorify God**  
The *Glorify God* themed study centers on our ultimate purpose as believers: to magnify the greatness and majesty of God in every aspect of life.

## **In Christ**  
The *In Christ* themed study delves into the profound biblical truth of union with Christ, which forms the foundation of the believer’s identity and spiritual life. By participating in Christ’s life, death, and resurrection, we are given new life, access to God’s grace, and the hope of eternal communion with Him. The study explores how this connection redefines our purpose, integrates us into His body, and calls us to live Spirit-led lives that reflect His love and fulfill His mission.

**John 15:5**

# Theosis: The Holistic Discipleship Journey

The Christian life is not about mere outward behaviors or religious observances. At its core, it is an ongoing, transformative journey of becoming more like Christ. This process, referred to as *Theosis*, invites believers to reflect God’s image more fully and participate in His divine nature.

The beauty of *Theosis* is that it is a holistic transformation, involving every aspect of our being—spirit, mind, and body. In the evangelical context, *Theosis* is understood as a process that God initiates and completes through the gospel, empowering believers to grow in Christlikeness by the Holy Spirit.

At the heart of this transformative journey are four foundational pillars: **Exalt**, **Emulate**, **Exemplify**, and **Embody**. These pillars guide believers in fulfilling their ultimate calling—to reflect the image of God as originally intended and as restored in Christ.

---

## 1. Exalt: Created to Glorify God

The first pillar of *Theosis* is living for the glory of God. From the beginning, humanity’s purpose has been to reflect and honor God’s greatness. In Isaiah 43:7, God declares, “Everyone who is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory.” This shows that glorifying God is the essence of our existence—both individually and as a collective people.

Jesus modeled this perfectly during His earthly ministry. In John 17:4, He prayed, “I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do.” Jesus’ life was a reflection of His obedience and devotion to the Father. As believers, we are called to follow His example. Everything we do—whether eating, drinking, or working—should be done for God’s glory (1 Corinthians 10:31).

**Practical Application**:  
- Start each day by committing all your plans and actions to God’s glory.  
- Ask God for the strength to make every part of your life a reflection of His goodness.  
- Cultivate a heart of gratitude for God’s provision and presence.

---

## 2. Emulate: Conformed to Christlikeness

The second pillar of *Theosis* is becoming more like Christ. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, believers are being transformed into the image of Jesus. Romans 8:29 states, “For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son.” The Christian life is a process of growing into Christlikeness—reflecting His love, humility, compassion, and obedience to the Father.

This transformation is gradual, accomplished by beholding Christ's glory through Scripture, worship, and prayer. As 2 Corinthians 3:18 affirms, “But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.” The more we look to Christ, the more the Holy Spirit works within us to make us like Him.

**Practical Application**:  
- Spend intentional time in the Gospels to learn from the life of Jesus.  
- Seek to imitate His character—especially His humility and love—daily.  
- Surround yourself with people who encourage you to pursue Christlikeness.

---

## 3. Exemplify: Called to Holy Living

Holiness is not merely an external display of good behavior; it is an internal transformation that leads to a life set apart for God. The third pillar of *Theosis* is the call to live a holy life that reflects God’s purity and righteousness. 1 Peter 1:15-16 reminds us, “But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.’”

Holiness is a response to God’s call, involving a willingness to reject sin and live according to God’s will. Romans 12:1-2 encourages believers to offer their bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, and not to conform to the patterns of this world. True holiness comes from the heart and is a life lived in obedience to God’s Word.

**Practical Application**:  
- Take time to examine your life and identify areas where sin needs to be surrendered to God.  
- Cultivate spiritual disciplines—such as prayer, fasting, and Bible study—that promote holiness.  
- Foster accountability with others who are also striving to live holy lives.

---

## 4. Embody: Connected to Christ's Life

The final pillar of *Theosis* is the believer’s union with Christ. This intimate relationship with Jesus is the foundation and power for every other aspect of spiritual transformation. In John 15:5, Jesus explains, “I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.”

Our union with Christ means that we no longer live for ourselves but for Him. In Galatians 2:20, Paul proclaims, “I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” This union empowers believers to live for God’s glory, reflect Christ's character, and set apart to fulfill His eternal purposes.

**Practical Application**:  
- Remain in constant fellowship with Christ through prayer and meditation on His Word.  
- Trust that your strength comes not from your own efforts but from Christ working in you.  
- Rest in the assurance that Christ will complete the good work He began in you (Philippians 1:6).

## Conclusion: Embrace the Journey of Theosis

*Theosis* is the beautiful process by which we are transformed into the likeness of Christ, empowered by the Holy Spirit. It is not an abstract theological concept but a practical and spiritual reality that shapes every part of the Christian life. Through **Exalting God**, **Emulating Christ**, **Exemplifying holiness**, and **Embodying union with Christ**, we grow into the people God created us to be—image-bearers of His glory.

This process is both a present reality and a future hope. As we continue to live out *Theosis* in our daily lives, we anticipate the ultimate fulfillment of this transformation when we see Christ face to face (1 John 3:2). Until that day, we press on with joy, confidence, and gratitude, knowing that God is faithfully at work within us to conform us to the image of His Son.

May we live out these pillars of *Theosis*, reflecting God’s glory in all we do, and trust in His power to complete the good work He has begun in us. As we journey through this transformative process, let us rest in the assurance that the God who called us to this great purpose will bring it to fruition, for His glory and our eternal good.
