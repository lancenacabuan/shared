# Theosis: Our Holy Calling to Glorify God, Emulate Christ, and Live Set Apart in Him

As believers, our divine calling is to glorify God by reflecting His holiness, truth, and love. This purpose is deeply connected to **Theosis**—the transformative process of being united with God and shaped into His likeness through Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. Theosis encompasses all aspects of our salvation: Justification, Sanctification, and Glorification. Each part works together to make us more like Christ and to enable us to fulfill God’s will.

Theosis invites us to partake in God's nature and be transformed, growing in holiness and reflecting His glory in every area of our lives. This grace-driven process begins with justification, continues through sanctification, and culminates in glorification, empowering us to glorify God, emulate Christ, and live set apart.

## Glorifying God: Our Ultimate Purpose

Glorifying God is why we were created. As Isaiah 43:7 says, “Everyone who is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory.” Every action, from work to relationships, should reflect God’s greatness. It’s not about perfection but about intentionally allowing His glory to shine through us.

1 Corinthians 10:31 reminds us to “do all to the glory of God.” Jesus exemplified this by fulfilling God’s will perfectly in John 17:4, saying, “I glorified You on the earth by accomplishing the work which You have given Me to do.” We glorify God by living faithfully and reflecting His character.

**Practical Application:**
- Begin each day praying for God’s glory to shine through you.
- In challenges, choose actions that honor Him.
- Practice gratitude, acknowledging His goodness in all things.

## Emulating Christ: Walking in His Steps

Emulating Christ means following His example of humility, love, and obedience. 1 Peter 2:21 says, “Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you would follow in His steps.” We are called to live as He did, in full surrender to God’s will and sacrificial love.

Philippians 2:3-5 describes Christ’s humility, urging us to “regard one another as more important than yourselves.” We emulate Christ by serving others selflessly, reflecting His love and compassion. 1 John 2:6 reminds us to “walk in the same manner as He walked.” 

**Practical Application:**
- Reflect on where you struggle to follow Christ’s example.
- Actively seek to serve others, showing Christ’s love.
- Meditate on the Gospels to deepen your understanding of Jesus’ life.

## Living Set Apart: A Call to Holiness

Holiness means being set apart for God’s purposes. 1 Peter 1:15-16 calls us to “be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written: ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.’” Holiness isn’t about legalism but surrendering to God’s transforming work.

As 2 Corinthians 3:18 teaches, we are “being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.” This lifelong process helps us reject worldly values and reflect God’s purity. In a world of compromise, living set apart is a powerful testimony.

**Practical Application:**
- Examine areas where worldly influences hinder your walk with Christ.
- Commit to daily prayer, Bible study, and fellowship to grow in holiness.
- Stand firm in your convictions, trusting God to honor your faithfulness.

## **In Christ: Our New Identity and Calling**

Being “in Christ” is central to Theosis. Through this union, we are granted new life and empowered to live for God’s glory. Romans 6:5-6 affirms, “If we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection.” This new identity frees us from sin’s power and calls us to live as Christ’s representatives.

John 15:5 illustrates our dependence on Christ: “I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him bears much fruit.” In Christ, we draw our life and strength, enabling us to bear fruit that glorifies God.

**Practical Application:**
- Embrace your new identity in Christ—knowing you are forgiven and loved.
- Live as a representative of Christ, reflecting His truth and love.
- Let your actions, thoughts, and relationships flow from your identity in Him.

### Living Out Our Holy Calling

Living a life that glorifies God, emulates Christ, and is set apart requires intentionality and dependence on God’s grace. Through Theosis, we are transformed into Christ’s image by the Holy Spirit.

- **Pursue Christlikeness**: Let Christ’s character guide your decisions.
- **Seek Holiness**: Surrender to God’s refining work daily.
- **Rely on Grace**: Trust in the Spirit’s power to transform you.
- **Reflect God’s Glory**: Be a light in the world, pointing others to God.

Through Theosis, we participate in God’s divine nature and reflect His glory. This is our calling for today and our eternal destiny: to be united with Him, transformed by His Spirit, and conformed to His image. Let us embrace this journey with joy, humility, and faith, trusting that God will complete His work in us.
