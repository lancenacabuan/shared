### **Theosis: Our Holy Calling of Glorifying God by Emulating Christ and Living Set Apart in Him**

As believers, our ultimate calling is to glorify God, reflecting His holiness, truth, and love in every aspect of our lives. This profound purpose is deeply rooted in Scripture and beautifully aligned with the concept of **theosis**—the process of being united with God and transformed into His likeness through Jesus Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit. Far from being an abstract theological idea, theosis invites us into a life that glorifies God, emulates Christ, and is set apart for His purposes.

Our journey of transformation is not simply a matter of duty or obligation but a gracious invitation to participate in God’s divine nature. By His Spirit, we are empowered to reflect His character and make His glory known to the world.

### **Glorifying God**

The ultimate purpose of our existence is to glorify God. **1 Corinthians 10:31** reminds us, “Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.” Glorifying God goes beyond outward actions; it is about aligning our hearts, minds, and wills with His, so that every area of our lives reflects His greatness.

We were created for this purpose, as **Isaiah 43:7** declares: “Everyone who is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory, whom I have formed, even whom I have made.” Just as the heavens declare the glory of God (**Psalm 19:1**), our lives are meant to declare His greatness through our love, obedience, and faithfulness.  

Jesus perfectly glorified the Father, saying in **John 17:4**, “I glorified You on the earth by accomplishing the work which You have given Me to do.” Following His example, we glorify God by living lives that reflect His character and accomplish His purposes. This is not achieved by our strength but through the transforming work of the Spirit within us. As we grow in Christlikeness, we become living testimonies of God’s glory.

### **Emulating Christ**

To emulate Christ is to walk as He walked, demonstrating His love, humility, and obedience in our own lives. **1 Peter 2:21** says, “For you have been called for this purpose, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you would follow in His steps.” Christ’s life reveals what humanity was created to be—perfectly reflecting the image of God.

Emulating Christ means adopting His mindset of humility, as described in **Philippians 2:3-5**: “Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves. Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus.” His sacrificial love calls us to live selflessly for others, as He demonstrated through His life and death on the cross. **1 John 2:6** reminds us, “The one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked.”

Through the power of the Holy Spirit, we are transformed into His likeness, reflecting His love, compassion, and righteousness in every area of our lives. This transformation, central to theosis, is not about achieving perfection in our own strength but about allowing Christ to live through us.

### **Living Set Apart**

Living set apart is the call to holiness, to be consecrated for God’s purposes. **1 Peter 1:15-16** instructs us, “But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written: ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.’” Holiness is more than moral purity; it is a state of being wholly devoted to God, allowing His Spirit to shape our thoughts, actions, and desires.

This calling to holiness requires rejecting the values and priorities of the world. As **2 Corinthians 3:18** explains, we are being transformed “from glory to glory” by the Spirit of the Lord. Holiness is not something we achieve by human effort but a work of God’s grace in our lives. By immersing ourselves in His Word, living in prayer, and participating in the fellowship of believers, we actively cooperate with His transforming power.

Being set apart means embodying a life that points others to God. This involves living counter-culturally, reflecting the purity, love, and truth of Christ in all we do. Holiness is not a burden but a gift—a participation in the very life of God.

### **Theosis: Our Eternal Destiny**

Theosis is not merely a process for this life; it is our eternal destiny. Through Christ’s redemptive work, we are united with Him and share in His resurrection life. **Romans 6:5-6** proclaims, “For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection.” In this union, we are freed from sin and empowered to live as Christ lived.

This transformation continues throughout our lives and is perfected in eternity. As **2 Corinthians 3:18** declares, we are being changed into God’s image “from glory to glory.” Theosis reminds us that our journey is one of ever-deepening union with God—a relationship that will culminate in the full revelation of His glory in us.

Our union with Christ is not a blending of natures but a profound relational connection. He abides in us, and we in Him (**John 15:5**). This abiding relationship is the foundation of our transformation, enabling us to reflect God’s holiness and love to a watching world.

### **A Call to Action**

Living a life that glorifies God, emulates Christ, and is set apart in holiness requires intentional commitment and dependence on God’s grace.  

- **Pursue Christlikeness**: Follow Christ’s example of humility, love, and selflessness in your daily life. Let His character shape your decisions, relationships, and priorities.  
- **Seek Holiness**: Commit to living a life that honors God by rejecting sin and aligning your life with His Word. Consecrate yourself fully to His purposes.  
- **Rely on Grace**: Remember that transformation is not achieved by human effort but by the Spirit’s work in you. Trust in God’s unmerited favor to empower your growth.  
- **Reflect God’s Glory**: In every aspect of your life, seek to make God’s greatness known. Let your words, actions, and relationships point others to Him.
