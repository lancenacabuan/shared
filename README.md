# Theosis: Our Holy Calling to Glorify God, Emulate Christ, and Live Set Apart in Him

As believers, our calling is to glorify God by becoming more like Christ, reflecting His holiness and love in every aspect of our lives. This process of transformation, known as **Theosis**, invites us into a deeper union with God through Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. Theosis is not just a theological concept, but a lived reality that shapes our identity, purpose, and actions as we are progressively conformed to the image of Christ.

Theosis encompasses the full scope of our salvation—**Justification**, **Sanctification**, and **Glorification**—each stage drawing us closer to God’s likeness. Through this transformative journey, we are called to glorify God, emulate Christ, and live set apart for His purpose. This is the ultimate goal of our Christian life: to reflect God’s glory, live as Christ did, and pursue holiness through the work of the Holy Spirit.

## Glorifying God: Our Ultimate Purpose

Glorifying God is why we were created. As **Isaiah 43:7** says, “Everyone who is called by My name, And whom I have created for My glory, Whom I have formed, even whom I have made.” Our lives were made to reflect His greatness, and every action should honor Him. Jesus exemplified this by fulfilling God’s will, saying in **John 17:4**, “I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do.”

**1 Corinthians 10:31** reminds us, “Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.”

Glorifying God involves both our actions and an attitude of reverence toward His will. It’s not just about doing things for God’s glory but about aligning our hearts with His purpose and recognizing His greatness in every area of our lives. This is what Jesus modeled perfectly: through His obedience and sacrifice, He glorified God.

**Practical Application:**
- Begin each day praying for God’s glory to shine through you.
- In challenges, choose actions that honor Him.
- Practice gratitude, acknowledging His goodness in all things.

## Emulating Christ: Walking in His Steps

To emulate Christ is to follow His example of humility, love, and obedience. **1 Peter 2:21** says, “For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps.”

**Philippians 2:3-5** teaches, “Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others. Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus.”

**1 John 2:6** adds, “The one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked.”

Emulating Christ is not only about moral imitation but also about **participating in His divine nature**. As we surrender to the Holy Spirit’s work, we grow in Christlikeness, which reflects God’s holiness in our lives. This transformation is empowered by the Spirit, making it possible for us to truly live as Christ lived.

**Practical Application:**
- Reflect on areas where you struggle to follow Christ’s example.
- Actively seek to serve others, showing Christ’s love.
- Meditate on the Gospels to deepen your understanding of Jesus’ life and actions.

## Living Set Apart: A Call to Holiness

Holiness means being set apart for God’s purposes. **1 Peter 1:15-16** calls us to “but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.’”

**2 Corinthians 3:18** teaches, “But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.”

Holiness is not just about avoiding sin but about surrendering ourselves to God’s transformative work. **Romans 12:1-2** urges, “Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.”

The process of holiness is an ongoing transformation, as we surrender to the Holy Spirit’s work in renewing our minds and shaping our lives to align with God’s character. According to 1 Thessalonians 4:3, God’s will for us is our sanctification—an internal change that progressively makes us more like Christ in our thoughts, attitudes, and actions.

**Practical Application:**
- Examine areas where worldly influences hinder your walk with Christ.
- Commit to daily prayer, Bible study, and fellowship to grow in holiness.
- Stand firm in your convictions, trusting God to honor your faithfulness.

## **In Christ: Our Transformative Union**

Being “in Christ” is central to *Theosis*. **Romans 6:5-6** affirms, “For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin.”

**John 15:5** illustrates our dependence on Christ: “I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.”

Our union with Christ empowers us to live for God’s glory. **Galatians 2:20** states, “I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.”

In Christ, we are not only imitating Him but are also **participating in His divine nature** (2 Peter 1:4). This union with Christ means we are empowered to live as He did, through the Holy Spirit, which transforms us from the inside out.

**Practical Application:**
- Embrace your new identity in Christ—knowing you are forgiven and loved.
- Live as a representative of Christ, reflecting His truth and love.
- Let your actions, thoughts, and relationships flow from your identity in Him.

## Living Out Our Holy Calling

Living out our holy calling means embracing *Theosis*—becoming more like Christ and reflecting God’s glory. We glorify God by aligning our lives with His purpose, emulating Christ’s humility, love, and obedience. Through holiness, we set ourselves apart for God’s work, continually transformed by the Holy Spirit.

Our union with Christ shapes our identity and empowers us to live in victory over sin, reflecting His divine nature. As we trust in the Spirit’s work, we grow more into His likeness, being transformed into His image from glory to glory.

Theosis is not just a future hope, but a present reality. It is the journey of becoming who we were meant to be—united with God, transformed by His Spirit, and conformed to Christ’s image. Let us embrace this journey with joy, trusting God to complete His work in us. Through His grace, we can reflect His glory to the world around us.
