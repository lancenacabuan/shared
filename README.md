Create the most optimal team of 3 Beyblades comprising different combinations of the main parts: "Blade," "Ratchet," and "Bit." Ensure that each unique part is used only once. Consider the stats of each part to balance out weaknesses and complement other parts for an optimal build. Here are the available parts for your selection:

These are the main "Blade" parts that can be used. Wait for instruction which 1 specific Blade or 3 main Blades I am interested to use:
=====PASTE APPLICABLE BLADE PARTS HERE=====
Note: Parameters are [Attack, Defense, Stamina]

The "Ratchets" serve as the central body of the Beyblade. The first digit indicates the number of bumps or contact points [more bumps mean a higher attack boost but also a greater chance of bursting]. The following two digits represent the height in millimeters, which determines the overall height of the Beyblade. Consider both factors for performance and durability.
=====PASTE APPLICABLE RATCHET PARTS HERE=====
Note: Parameters are [Attack, Defense, Stamina]

The "Bit" parts refer to the tip under the Beyblade, influencing its movement, behavior, and burstability based on their stats. Keep in mind that Beyblades can burst and utilize the Dash mechanic on the stadium.
=====PASTE APPLICABLE BIT PARTS HERE=====
Note: Parameters are [Attack, Defense, Stamina, Dash, Burst Resistance]

Important Notes:
- Do not entirely rely on stats parameter for builds but also consider these following information below.
- Burst Resistance via Bit part 5th parameter are only either High-enduring (80) or Low-enduring (30) burstability.
- Burst Resistance via Ratchet part height is more enduring on (?-60) 60mm compared to (?-80) 80mm; unless a more enduring Bit part is used to supplement it.
- More protrusions on Ratchet part especially if on 80mm height boosts attack but makes build more burstable; unless a more enduring Bit part is used to supplement it.
- Attack boost via Ratchet height is more powerful if taller (?-80) 80mm yet more susceptible or burstable.
- Stamina via Ratchet height lasts longer on (?-60) 60mm compared to (?-80) 80mm unless supplemented with high Blade/Bit.
- Higher Dash stat parameter via Bit part enhances Attack performance but lessen Stamina.

List the final build combos using this exact naming convention:
Example: Knight Lance 4-80HN

Then include the Total Overall Stats: [Attack, Defense, Stamina, Dash, Burst Resistance]
Formula:
- Attack, Defense, and Stamina:
 - Attack = Sum Total Attack from Blade, Ratchet, Bit
 - Defense = Sum Total Defense from Blade, Ratchet, Bit
 - Stamina = Sum Total Stamina from Blade, Ratchet, Bit
- Dash and Burst Resistance: Take the value directly from the Bit part.

Additionally, describe in-depth the playstyle, win condition, and the reasoning behind the build of each Beyblade.

Just take notes of all given information and wait for additional data and go signal before generating anything.
