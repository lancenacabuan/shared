## **Glorify God**  
The *Glorify God* themed study centers on our ultimate purpose as believers: to magnify the greatness and majesty of God in every aspect of life.

Moving through the life of Christ, it highlights how Jesus perfectly glorified the Father through His obedience, sacrifice, and exaltation. Finally, it emphasizes how we are called to reflect God’s glory daily through our worship, conduct, and testimony. This study reminds us that glorifying God is not only a command but the essence of our existence, shaping our identity and purpose as His people.

## **Set Apart**  
The *Set Apart* themed study guides believers in understanding the biblical call to holiness, as exemplified in 1 Peter. It unpacks holiness as not merely external behavior but an inner transformation that sets us apart for God’s purposes. Through themes such as the conduct, challenge, and commitment of holiness, it explores how we can honor God in our actions, resist worldly temptations, and endure trials with faith. Empowered by grace and modeled after Christ’s own holiness, this study encourages us to live as witnesses to God’s character, reflecting His light in a dark world, and glorifying Him in all we do.

## **In Christ**  
The *In Christ* themed study delves into the profound biblical truth of union with Christ, which forms the foundation of the believer’s identity and spiritual life. By participating in Christ’s life, death, and resurrection, we are given new life, access to God’s grace, and the hope of eternal communion with Him. The study explores how this connection redefines our purpose, integrates us into His body, and calls us to live Spirit-led lives that reflect His love and fulfill His mission. Anchoring believers in the transformative power of life through Christ, it inspires confidence in God’s promises and a deeper commitment to living for His glory.

## **Theosis: Our Holy Calling to Reflect God’s Glory in Christ**

As believers, we are called not just to live for God but to be transformed into His likeness. This ongoing process of becoming more like Christ is known as *Theosis*, a Greek term that refers to the divine transformation of believers into the image of God. Through *Theosis*, we experience a deeper union with God in Christ, empowered by the Holy Spirit, so that our lives increasingly reflect His glory. 

*Theosis* is not just a theological concept; it is the heart of our salvation—our justification, sanctification, and ultimate glorification. It is the journey of being conformed to the image of Christ, a journey that shapes our identity, purpose, and daily actions.

In this blog, we will explore the key elements of *Theosis*: Glorifying God, Emulating Christ, Living Set Apart in Holiness, and Being United with Christ. These are not separate tasks but interconnected aspects of our calling, each one essential for us to fully live out our transformation in Him.

---

### **1. Glorifying God: The Core Purpose of Our Existence**

Our calling begins with the understanding that we were created for one ultimate purpose: to glorify God. 

**Isaiah 43:7** reminds us, “Everyone who is called by My name, And whom I have created for My glory, Whom I have formed, even whom I have made.” God’s purpose in creating us is to reflect His greatness. This aligns with *Theosis*—as we become more like Christ, we increasingly reflect God’s glory, fulfilling the purpose for which we were made.

Jesus perfectly exemplified this in His life on earth. In **John 17:4**, He prayed, “I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do.” Through His obedience, Jesus glorified the Father. 

Similarly, **1 Corinthians 10:31** calls us to do everything to God’s glory: “Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.” Glorifying God encompasses every action, big or small, in our lives.

**Practical Application:**
- Start each day with a prayer, asking God to help you reflect His glory.
- In your daily decisions, choose to honor God.
- Cultivate gratitude for His goodness and acknowledge Him in all things.

### **2. Emulating Christ: Following His Example of Love and Obedience**

The call to glorify God leads us to the next aspect of *Theosis*: emulating Christ. Christ’s life serves as the ultimate example for us to follow. To emulate Him is to walk in His footsteps of humility, love, and obedience.

**1 Peter 2:21** says, “For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps.” Jesus endured suffering and rejection, not out of obligation, but to fulfill God’s will and to model sacrificial love. We are called to follow His example in every area of life.

**Philippians 2:3-5** encourages us to adopt the same mindset as Christ: “Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others. Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus.”

Furthermore, **1 John 2:6** reminds us, “The one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked.” Emulating Christ is not just about external behavior but about internal transformation. We are called to **participate** in His divine nature, allowing the Holy Spirit to conform us to His image.

**Practical Application:**
- Reflect on how Christ demonstrated love and humility. Seek to imitate these qualities in your relationships.
- Serve others selflessly, following Christ’s example.
- Meditate on the Gospels to better understand the heart and actions of Jesus.

### **3. Living Set Apart: Embracing Holiness as Our New Identity**

*Theosis* also involves living a life of holiness, being set apart for God’s purposes. As we grow in Christ, our lives should increasingly reflect His holiness, which calls for a deep transformation of our hearts and minds.

In **1 Peter 1:15-16**, God commands, “But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.’” Holiness is not about perfection in action but being set apart for God's work. As believers, we are called to live distinct lives that point others to God.

**2 Corinthians 3:18** speaks of this ongoing transformation: “But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.” As we behold God’s glory, we are being transformed into His likeness.

**Romans 12:1-2** offers a practical command: “Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.” Holiness is an ongoing process of mind renewal and surrender to God’s will.

**Practical Application:**
- Identify areas where worldly influences are pulling you away from holiness and seek God’s help to overcome them.
- Commit to daily spiritual practices—prayer, Bible reading, and fellowship—to nurture your holiness.
- Stand firm in your convictions, trusting God to honor your efforts.

### **4. In Christ: The Union That Powers Our Transformation**

The heart of *Theosis* is our union with Christ. Through this union, we are not just imitating Christ, but we are **participating in His divine nature** (2 Peter 1:4). This union empowers our transformation and enables us to live for God’s glory.

**Romans 6:5-6** affirms this union: “For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin.”

In **John 15:5**, Jesus says, “I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.” Our dependence on Christ is essential for fruitfulness in the Christian life. It is through His power, not our own, that we are transformed into His image.

**Galatians 2:20** beautifully captures this truth: “I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.” The life of *Theosis* is one where we no longer live for ourselves but live in Christ.

**Practical Application:**
- Embrace your new identity in Christ—recognizing that you are forgiven and made new in Him.
- Let your thoughts, actions, and relationships flow from your union with Christ.
- Remember that transformation happens as you remain in Christ and depend on Him for strength.

### **5. Living Out Our Holy Calling: Embracing the Journey of Theosis**

*Theosis* is not just a future hope; it is a present reality that shapes our lives today. As we grow in Christ, we glorify God, emulate His character, and live set apart for His purposes. We are empowered to do all this through our union with Christ, who transforms us from the inside out.

The journey of *Theosis* is the journey of becoming who we were always meant to be—God’s children, reflecting His glory, living in the power of Christ’s resurrection, and becoming more like Him every day. 

As we trust in the Holy Spirit’s work, we are continually transformed, moving from one degree of glory to the next. Let us embrace this calling with joy and faith, knowing that through God’s grace, we are being conformed to the image of His Son.

**Practical Application:**
- Walk in the freedom of knowing your identity is in Christ—this is the foundation of transformation.
- Reflect on how each area of your life can reflect God’s glory more fully.
- Trust in the Holy Spirit’s power to continue the work of transformation in your life.

---

### **Conclusion**

*Theosis* is the Christian journey of becoming more like Christ, reflecting His glory, and living set apart for God’s purposes. It is a dynamic process that involves our entire lives—our thoughts, actions, and relationships. It begins with the recognition that we are called to glorify God, follow Christ’s example, embrace holiness, and live in union with Christ.

Let us respond to this holy calling with open hearts, trusting that God will continue to transform us, so that we can live for His glory and fulfill the purpose for which we were created.
